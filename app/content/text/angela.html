Angela grew up in Sydney, Australia, and first experienced Yoga at age 16 whilst working with a touring theatre company. She revisited Yoga technique alongside dance and contemporary theatre at Univeristy, but after giving birth to her son she began to really use Yoga practice in a healing capacity for mind, body and soul.

Angela is deeply passionate about healing and continually evolving - creating Endorphin Yoga in 2014 was the best to be of service through her knowledge. Her style of teaching continues to change and adapt as she draws on experiences that shift consciousness.
